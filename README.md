# SolidJS template

A template for simple frontend apps/widgets.

## Building blocks

- SolidJS
- TypeScript
- @solidjs/router
- Tailwind CSS
- PNPM
- Vite

## Requirements

- Node 18
- pnpm

## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm dev` or `pnpm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `pnpm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
